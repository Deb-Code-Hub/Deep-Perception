# Deep Perception: A Computer Vision Website

This project is a computer vision website built using the Django framework, providing the following five main features:

- **Colour Detection using HSV**
- **Object Detection using YOLOv3**
- **Sign Language Detection using SSD**
- **Face Recognition using HOG + Linear SVM**
- **Handwriting Recognition using CNN**

## Features

### Colour Detection using HSV
This feature allows users to detect and identify different colors within an image using the HSV color space.

### Object Detection using YOLOv3
Utilizes the YOLOv3 algorithm to detect various objects within images in real-time.

### Sign Language Detection using SSD
Implements a Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) to recognize and interpret sign language gestures from images or videos.

### Face Recognition using HOG + Linear SVM
Employs Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) for face detection and recognition.

### Handwriting Recognition using CNN
Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze and recognize handwritten text.
